# CEAI - CEO AI

A satirical web application that uses AI to respond like a CEO in different contexts.

## About

CEO AI is a humorous take on corporate communication, offering three distinct modes:
- **Public Mode**: Corporate PR-friendly responses full of buzzwords
- **CEO Mode**: Direct, bottom-line focused executive speak
- **Private Mode**: Brutally honest, unfiltered responses

## Features

- 🤖 Powered by Google Gemini AI (free tier)

3. **Set up your Gemini API key:**
